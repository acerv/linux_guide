# What's this?
When time passes, I forget easy things I'm working on.
This is a Linux guide I write to remember those easy things.

The following list explains what's inside files:
* bash.txt: bash programming
* develop.txt: development tools
* devices.txt: devices handling
* filesystem.txt: filesystem handling
* git.txt: git usage
* hacking.txt: hack stuff
* kernel.txt: kernel tools
* net_remote.txt: remote network tools
* packaging.txt: packaging tools (rpm, dpkg, i.e.)
* doc/: useful documents about Linux
* utils/: useful tools
