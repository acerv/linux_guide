===============
REDIRECT OUTPUT
===============

To redirecto the output to a file, and show the output on terminal as well:

    $ command | tee [-a] stdout.log

The following command works always, even if the command is redirecting stdout:

    $ command > >(tee stdout.log) 2> >(tee stderr.log >&2)
